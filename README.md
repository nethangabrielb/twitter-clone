## 📖 About the Project

Chirper is a fullstack Twitter/X-inspired social media application that replicates the core social experience: composing posts, following users, liking and replying to content, sending direct messages in real time, and receiving live notifications — all inside a responsive UI.

The project is structured as a **pnpm monorepo** with three workspaces: a Node.js/Express backend, a Next.js 16 frontend, and a shared TypeScript types package consumed by both ends.

### Why I Built This

I wanted to cap off The Odin Project's Node.js curriculum with something I'd actually be proud to show — not just a checkbox project, but a realistic, production-leaning social media application. The challenge was to take an open-ended brief and make deliberate decisions about scope, architecture, and polish without losing momentum.

> 📚 Built in partial fulfillment of [The Odin Project – Odin-Book](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-odin-book), the **final project** of the Full Stack JavaScript / NodeJS Course. All core requirements are met, and every extra credit item was implemented and then some.

### What I Learned

- How to design and scale a **pnpm monorepo** with shared TypeScript types across frontend and backend workspaces.
- How to implement a strict **Controller → Service → Repository** layered architecture across 10 domains, keeping business logic cleanly separated from HTTP and database concerns.
- How to layer multiple auth strategies — email/password, **Google OIDC via Passport.js**, and a **read-only guest mode** — all sharing the same JWT cookie flow.
- How to integrate **Socket.IO** for real-time chat and live notifications (likes, replies, follows) including connection state recovery and per-socket auth validation.
- How to model a complex social graph in Prisma — self-referential posts for replies, implicit many-to-many room membership, soft deletes, and cursor-based pagination.
- How to handle **multipart file uploads** with `multer` and wire them to **Supabase object storage**, including cleanup of old avatars on update.
- How to build a fully responsive UI across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints using Next.js App Router, TailwindCSS 4, and Radix UI primitives.
- How to deploy a containerized application to the cloud by provisioning a **DigitalOcean Droplet**,
  running the backend via Docker, and wiring it up to a live domain.

## Architecture
```
pnpm monorepo
├── apps/backend      Express API  ──► Controller → Service → Repository
├── apps/frontend     Next.js App Router
└── packages/shared   TypeScript interfaces shared across workspaces
```

The backend follows a strict layered pattern across 10 domains (auth, users, posts, comments, follows, likes, rooms, messages, bookmarks, notifications). REST handles all CRUD operations; Socket.IO handles real-time events on a separate connection authenticated via the same JWT cookie.
```
Client (Next.js)
    │  REST (credentials: include)
    │  Socket.IO (cookie auth)
    ▼
Express 5 API
    ├── authMiddleware (JWT cookie verify)
    ├── guestAuthMiddleware (blocks writes for guest sessions)
    ├── Controller → Service → Repository (per domain)
    ├── Prisma ORM → PostgreSQL
    ├── multer → Supabase Storage
    └── Socket.IO Server (connection state recovery, 2-min window)
```
